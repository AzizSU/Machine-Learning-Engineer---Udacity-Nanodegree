In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!

In addition to implementing code, there will be questions that you must answer which relate to the project and your implementation. Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with **'Answer:'**. Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  

>**Note:** Code and Markdown cells can be executed using the **Shift + Enter** keyboard shortcut. In addition, Markdown cells can be edited by typically double-clicking the cell to enter edit mode.

## Getting Started

In this project, you will analyze a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts (reported in *monetary units*) of diverse product categories for internal structure. One goal of this project is to best describe the variation in the different types of customers that a wholesale distributor interacts with. Doing so would equip the distributor with insight into how to best structure their delivery service to meet the needs of each customer.

The dataset for this project can be found on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wholesale+customers). For the purposes of this project, the features `'Channel'` and `'Region'` will be excluded in the analysis â€” with focus instead on the six product categories recorded for customers.

Run the code block below to load the wholesale customers dataset, along with a few of the necessary Python libraries required for this project. You will know the dataset loaded successfully if the size of the dataset is reported.


```python
# Import libraries necessary for this project
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from IPython.display import display # Allows the use of display() for DataFrames

# Import supplementary visualizations code visuals.py
import visuals as vs

# Pretty display for notebooks
%matplotlib inline

# Load the wholesale customers dataset
try:
    data = pd.read_csv("customers.csv")
    data.drop(['Region', 'Channel'], axis = 1, inplace = True)
    print("Wholesale customers dataset has {} samples with {} features each.".format(*data.shape))
except:
    print("Dataset could not be loaded. Is the dataset missing?")
```

    Wholesale customers dataset has 440 samples with 6 features each.



```python
data.head(5)
```

## Data Exploration
In this section, you will begin exploring the data through visualizations and code to understand how each feature is related to the others. You will observe a statistical description of the dataset, consider the relevance of each feature, and select a few sample data points from the dataset which you will track through the course of this project.

Run the code block below to observe a statistical description of the dataset. Note that the dataset is composed of six important product categories: **'Fresh'**, **'Milk'**, **'Grocery'**, **'Frozen'**, **'Detergents_Paper'**, and **'Delicatessen'**. Consider what each category represents in terms of products you could purchase.


```python
# Display a description of the dataset
display(data.describe())
```

### Implementation: Selecting Samples
To get a better understanding of the customers and how their data will transform through the analysis, it would be best to select a few sample data points and explore them in more detail. In the code block below, add **three** indices of your choice to the `indices` list which will represent the customers to track. It is suggested to try different sets of samples until you obtain customers that vary significantly from one another.


```python
#Select three indices of your choice you wish to sample from the dataset
indices = [2,100,200]

# Create a DataFrame of the chosen samples
samples = pd.DataFrame(data.loc[indices], columns = data.keys()).reset_index(drop = True)
print("Chosen samples of wholesale customers dataset:")
display(samples)
```

    Chosen samples of wholesale customers dataset:

### Question 1
Consider the total purchase cost of each product category and the statistical description of the dataset above for your sample customers.  

* What kind of establishment (customer) could each of the three samples you've chosen represent?

* Fresh: 12000.2977
* Milk: 5796.2
* Grocery: 7951.3
* Detergents_paper: 2881.4
* Delicatessen: 1524.8

Knowing this, how do your samples compare? Does that help in driving your insight into what kind of establishments they might be? 


**Answer:**

1. Customer 2:   
  We can see that customer 2 is spending less on fresh, Grocery and Frozen and higher amounts on other catogrois. It could be a barbeque restaurant.
  
  
2. Customer 100: <br>
  We can see that the customer is spending a lot on Fresh, Detergents_Paper and Grocery. We could say that it is a super market store. 
   
   
3. Customer 200: <br>
  We can see that the customer is spending more on milk, Grocery and Detergents Paper. It could be a coffee house that serves small meals and snacks as well. 


### Implementation: Feature Relevance
One interesting thought to consider is if one (or more) of the six product categories is actually relevant for understanding customer purchasing. That is to say, is it possible to determine whether customers purchasing some amount of one category of products will necessarily purchase some proportional amount of another category of products? We can make this determination quite easily by training a supervised regression learner on a subset of the data with one feature removed, and then score how well that model can predict the removed feature.

In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
 - Assign `new_data` a copy of the data by removing a feature of your choice using the `DataFrame.drop` function.
 - Use `sklearn.cross_validation.train_test_split` to split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Use the removed feature as your target label. Set a `test_size` of `0.25` and set a `random_state`.
 - Import a decision tree regressor, set a `random_state`, and fit the learner to the training data.
 - Report the prediction score of the testing set using the regressor's `score` function.


```python
from sklearn.cross_validation import train_test_split
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor



def feature_Relevance(feature):
    #Make a copy of the DataFrame, using the 'drop' function to drop the given feature
    new_data =  data.drop([feature], axis = 1)

    #Split the data into training and testing sets(0.25) using the given feature as the target
    # Set a random state.
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test =  train_test_split(new_data, data[feature], test_size=0.25, random_state=4)
    #Create a decision tree regressor and fit it to the training set
    regressor = DecisionTreeRegressor(random_state=0)
    fit = regressor.fit(X_train, y_train)
    regressor = DecisionTreeRegressor(random_state=0)
    fit = regressor.fit(X_train, y_train)
    #Report the score of the prediction using the testing set
    score =  fit.score(X_test, y_test)
    print("R^2 is {} after removing the {} feature".format(score, feature))
    
```

    /anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/sklearn/cross_validation.py:41: DeprecationWarning: This module was deprecated in version 0.18 in favor of the model_selection module into which all the refactored classes and functions are moved. Also note that the interface of the new CV iterators are different from that of this module. This module will be removed in 0.20.
      "This module will be removed in 0.20.", DeprecationWarning)



```python
for feature in data.columns.values:
    feature_Relevance(feature)
```

    R^2 is -0.40129763338664026 after removing the Fresh feature
    R^2 is 0.5814660100952069 after removing the Milk feature
    R^2 is 0.7184131674681453 after removing the Grocery feature
    R^2 is -0.18348227141969176 after removing the Frozen feature
    R^2 is 0.6876022184905188 after removing the Detergents_Paper feature
    R^2 is -9.50344811140378 after removing the Delicatessen feature


### Question 2

* Which feature did you attempt to predict? 
* What was the reported prediction score? 
* Is this feature necessary for identifying customers' spending habits?


**Answer:**

The prediction was done on all the 6 features. And the result is the following: 

- Fresh: -0.40129763338664026 
- Milk: 0.5814660100952069
- Grocery: 0.7184131674681453
- Frozen: -0.18348227141969176
- Detergents Paper: 0.6876022184905188
- Delicatessen: -9.50344811140378


We can see that the Grocery scored 0.7 which is close to 1, followed by the Detergents Paper 0.69 and Milk 0.58 score.  
However, we see that the other features scored with negative values which means that the model failed to fit the data leading that these features should be considered when trying to identifying customers' spending habits. These are the following: 
- Frozen 
- Delicatessen
- Fresh


### Visualize Feature Distributions
To get a better understanding of the dataset, we can construct a scatter matrix of each of the six product features present in the data. If you found that the feature you attempted to predict above is relevant for identifying a specific customer, then the scatter matrix below may not show any correlation between that feature and the others. Conversely, if you believe that feature is not relevant for identifying a specific customer, the scatter matrix might show a correlation between that feature and another feature in the data. Run the code block below to produce a scatter matrix.


```python
# Produce a scatter matrix for each pair of features in the data
pd.plotting.scatter_matrix(data, alpha = 0.3, figsize = (14,8), diagonal = 'kde');
```


![png](output_18_0.png)



```python
from scipy.stats import boxcox
boxcox_data = data.apply(lambda x: boxcox(x)[0])
pd.plotting.scatter_matrix(boxcox_data, alpha = 0.3, figsize = (14,10), diagonal = 'kde');
```


![png](output_19_0.png)


### Question 3
* Using the scatter matrix as a reference, discuss the distribution of the dataset, specifically talk about the normality, outliers, large number of data points near 0 among others. If you need to sepearate out some of the plots individually to further accentuate your point, you may do so as well.
* Are there any pairs of features which exhibit some degree of correlation? 
* Does this confirm or deny your suspicions about the relevance of the feature you attempted to predict? 
* How is the data for those features distributed?

**Answer:**

Overall the data is not normally distributed. In fact we can see that the data has positively Skewed distribution for all the features. Most of the data appear to be near 0 which will have an effect on the performance of the algorithm. We should try to normalize the data to have a normal distribution. 

We can see that Detergents Paper and grocery have a high correlation, as well as frozen and Detergents. Other features share some level of correlation as well. such as Milk and grocery. However, we can see that for each of the following features: fresh, frozen and Delicatessen we have no correlation with other features, as was the suspicions earlier. 

## Data Preprocessing
In this section, you will preprocess the data to create a better representation of customers by performing a scaling on the data and detecting (and optionally removing) outliers. Preprocessing data is often times a critical step in assuring that results you obtain from your analysis are significant and meaningful.

### Implementation: Feature Scaling
If data is not normally distributed, especially if the mean and median vary significantly (indicating a large skew), it is most [often appropriate](http://econbrowser.com/archives/2014/02/use-of-logarithms-in-economics) to apply a non-linear scaling â€” particularly for financial data. One way to achieve this scaling is by using a [Box-Cox test](http://scipy.github.io/devdocs/generated/scipy.stats.boxcox.html), which calculates the best power transformation of the data that reduces skewness. A simpler approach which can work in most cases would be applying the natural logarithm.

In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
 - Assign a copy of the data to `log_data` after applying logarithmic scaling. Use the `np.log` function for this.
 - Assign a copy of the sample data to `log_samples` after applying logarithmic scaling. Again, use `np.log`.


```python
#Scale the data using the natural logarithm
log_data = np.log(data)

# TODO: Scale the sample data using the natural logarithm
log_samples =  pd.DataFrame(log_data.loc[indices], columns = data.keys()).reset_index(drop = True)

# Produce a scatter matrix for each pair of newly-transformed features
pd.plotting.scatter_matrix(log_data, alpha = 0.3, figsize = (14,8), diagonal = 'kde');
```


![png](output_25_0.png)


### Observation
After applying a natural logarithm scaling to the data, the distribution of each feature should appear much more normal. For any pairs of features you may have identified earlier as being correlated, observe here whether that correlation is still present (and whether it is now stronger or weaker than before).

Run the code below to see how the sample data has changed after having the natural logarithm applied to it.


```python
# Display the log-transformed sample data
display(log_samples)
```

### Implementation: Outlier Detection
Detecting outliers in the data is extremely important in the data preprocessing step of any analysis. The presence of outliers can often skew results which take into consideration these data points. There are many "rules of thumb" for what constitutes an outlier in a dataset. Here, we will use [Tukey's Method for identfying outliers](http://datapigtechnologies.com/blog/index.php/highlighting-outliers-in-your-data-with-the-tukey-method/): An *outlier step* is calculated as 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR). A data point with a feature that is beyond an outlier step outside of the IQR for that feature is considered abnormal.

In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
 - Assign the value of the 25th percentile for the given feature to `Q1`. Use `np.percentile` for this.
 - Assign the value of the 75th percentile for the given feature to `Q3`. Again, use `np.percentile`.
 - Assign the calculation of an outlier step for the given feature to `step`.
 - Optionally remove data points from the dataset by adding indices to the `outliers` list.

**NOTE:** If you choose to remove any outliers, ensure that the sample data does not contain any of these points!  
Once you have performed this implementation, the dataset will be stored in the variable `good_data`.


```python
# For each feature find the data points with extreme high or low values
from itertools import groupby
outliers  = []
for feature in log_data.keys():
    
    #Calculate Q1 (25th percentile of the data) for the given feature
    Q1 = np.percentile(log_data[feature], 25)
    
    #Calculate Q3 (75th percentile of the data) for the given feature
    Q3 = np.percentile(log_data[feature], 75)
    
    #Use the interquartile range to calculate an outlier step (1.5 times the interquartile range)
    step =  1.5 * (Q3 - Q1)
    
    # Display the outliers
    print("Data points considered outliers for the feature '{}':".format(feature))
    inner_outliers = log_data[~((log_data[feature] >= Q1 - step) & (log_data[feature] <= Q3 + step))]
    display(log_data[~((log_data[feature] >= Q1 - step) & (log_data[feature] <= Q3 + step))])
    outliers.append(list(inner_outliers.index.values))
    
outliers = list(sum(outliers, []))
s=pd.Series(outliers)
outliers = s[s.duplicated()].unique().tolist()
print("Indices to be removed '{}':".format(outliers))
# Remove the outliers
good_data = log_data.drop(log_data.index[outliers]).reset_index(drop = True)
```

    Indices to be removed '[154, 65, 75, 66, 128]':


### Question 4
* Are there any data points considered outliers for more than one feature based on the definition above? 
* Should these data points be removed from the dataset? 
* If any data points were added to the `outliers` list to be removed, explain why.


**Answer:**

The following Indices was outilers for more than one feature: 154, 65, 75, 66, 128 and they have been removed. The reason for removing these data is that it would prevent their affection when applying Gaussian Mixture or k-means on the data by creating outlier clusters which may contains points from the real clusters. Hence, these outliers data might result in wrong biaises model. 

## Feature Transformation
In this section you will use principal component analysis (PCA) to draw conclusions about the underlying structure of the wholesale customer data. Since using PCA on a dataset calculates the dimensions which best maximize variance, we will find which compound combinations of features best describe customers.

### Implementation: PCA

Now that the data has been scaled to a more normal distribution and has had any necessary outliers removed, we can now apply PCA to the `good_data` to discover which dimensions about the data best maximize the variance of features involved. In addition to finding these dimensions, PCA will also report the *explained variance ratio* of each dimension â€” how much variance within the data is explained by that dimension alone. Note that a component (dimension) from PCA can be considered a new "feature" of the space, however it is a composition of the original features present in the data.

In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
 - Import `sklearn.decomposition.PCA` and assign the results of fitting PCA in six dimensions with `good_data` to `pca`.
 - Apply a PCA transformation of `log_samples` using `pca.transform`, and assign the results to `pca_samples`.


```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

#Apply PCA by fitting the good data with the same number of dimensions as features
pca =  PCA(n_components=len(good_data.keys())).fit(good_data)

# Transform log_samples using the PCA fit above
pca_samples =  pca.transform(log_samples)

# Generate PCA results plot
pca_results = vs.pca_results(good_data, pca)
print (pca_results['Explained Variance'].to_string())
```

    Dimension 1    0.4430
    Dimension 2    0.2638
    Dimension 3    0.1231
    Dimension 4    0.1012
    Dimension 5    0.0485
    Dimension 6    0.0204



![png](output_34_1.png)


### Question 5

* How much variance in the data is explained* **in total** *by the first and second principal component? 
* How much variance in the data is explained by the first four principal components? 
* Using the visualization provided above, talk about each dimension and the cumulative variance explained by each, stressing upon which features are well represented by each dimension(both in terms of positive and negative variance explained). Discuss what the first four dimensions best represent in terms of customer spending.


**Answer:**


```python
print("First and Second components: \n{}".format(pca_results['Explained Variance'][0:2].to_string()) )
print("In total: {}" .format(pca_results['Explained Variance'][0:2].sum()))
```

    First and Second components: 
    Dimension 1    0.4430
    Dimension 2    0.2638
    In total: 0.7068



```python
print("First four components: \n{}".format(pca_results['Explained Variance'][0:4].to_string()) )
print("In total: {}" .format(pca_results['Explained Variance'][0:4].sum()))
```

    First four components: 
    Dimension 1    0.4430
    Dimension 2    0.2638
    Dimension 3    0.1231
    Dimension 4    0.1012
    In total: 0.9310999999999999


**Dimension 1**: <br> 
We can see it shows high weights for fresh and frozen while highly negative values for milk, Grocery and Detergents_Paper.
We can say it represents day to day purchases (frozen and fresh) and others purchased together. 

**Dimension 2**: <br> 
We can see that all features are negatively weighted but the followings are highly negatively weighted: fresh, frozen and Delicatessen. This might represents Restaurants' spendings.

**Dimension 3**: <br> 
Delicatessen and frozen are highly positively weighted while Fresh is negatively weighted. 
This might represents a diet store market.

**Dimension 4**: <br> 
Frozen is positively weighted and Delicatessen is negatively weighted. 
This might represents frozen food store. 



### Observation

Observe the numerical value for the first four dimensions of the sample points. Consider if this is consistent with your initial interpretation of the sample points.

# Display sample log-data after having a PCA transformation applied
display(pd.DataFrame(np.round(pca_samples, 4), columns = pca_results.index.values))

### Implementation: Dimensionality Reduction
When using principal component analysis, one of the main goals is to reduce the dimensionality of the data â€” in effect, reducing the complexity of the problem. Dimensionality reduction comes at a cost: Fewer dimensions used implies less of the total variance in the data is being explained. Because of this, the *cumulative explained variance ratio* is extremely important for knowing how many dimensions are necessary for the problem. Additionally, if a signifiant amount of variance is explained by only two or three dimensions, the reduced data can be visualized afterwards.

In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
 - Assign the results of fitting PCA in two dimensions with `good_data` to `pca`.
 - Apply a PCA transformation of `good_data` using `pca.transform`, and assign the results to `reduced_data`.
 - Apply a PCA transformation of `log_samples` using `pca.transform`, and assign the results to `pca_samples`.


```python
#Apply PCA by fitting the good data with only two dimensions
pca = PCA(n_components=2).fit(good_data)

#Transform the good data using the PCA fit above
reduced_data =  pca.transform(good_data)

# Transform log_samples using the PCA fit above
pca_samples =  pca.transform(log_samples)

# Create a DataFrame for the reduced data
reduced_data = pd.DataFrame(reduced_data, columns = ['Dimension 1', 'Dimension 2'])
```

### Observation
Run the code below to see how the log-transformed sample data has changed after having a PCA transformation applied to it using only two dimensions. Observe how the values for the first two dimensions remains unchanged when compared to a PCA transformation in six dimensions.


```python
# Display sample log-data after applying PCA transformation in two dimensions
display(pd.DataFrame(np.round(pca_samples, 4), columns = ['Dimension 1', 'Dimension 2']))
```

## Visualizing a Biplot
A biplot is a scatterplot where each data point is represented by its scores along the principal components. The axes are the principal components (in this case `Dimension 1` and `Dimension 2`). In addition, the biplot shows the projection of the original features along the components. A biplot can help us interpret the reduced dimensions of the data, and discover relationships between the principal components and original features.

Run the code cell below to produce a biplot of the reduced-dimension data.


```python
# Create a biplot
vs.biplot(good_data, reduced_data, pca)
```




    <matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x1a205154e0>




![png](output_47_1.png)


### Observation

Once we have the original feature projections (in red), it is easier to interpret the relative position of each data point in the scatterplot. For instance, a point the lower right corner of the figure will likely correspond to a customer that spends a lot on `'Milk'`, `'Grocery'` and `'Detergents_Paper'`, but not so much on the other product categories. 


We can see that the following features are strongly correlated with the first component:
- Detergents_Paper 
- Grocery
- Milk 

And the followings are strongly correlated with the second component:
- Delicatessen
- Frozen
- Fresh

These observations agree with the pca_results obtained before. 




## Clustering

In this section, you will choose to use either a K-Means clustering algorithm or a Gaussian Mixture Model clustering algorithm to identify the various customer segments hidden in the data. You will then recover specific data points from the clusters to understand their significance by transforming them back into their original dimension and scale. 

### Question 6

* What are the advantages to using a K-Means clustering algorithm? 
* What are the advantages to using a Gaussian Mixture Model clustering algorithm? 
* Given your observations about the wholesale customer data so far, which of the two algorithms will you use and why?



**Answer:**

**K-Means clustering algorithm: ** 
  - advantages: 
     + Fast algorithm, it usually runs in leaner time complexity. 
     + It depends on some assumptions, however, even if some of these assumptions are broken it seems to work well 
     + It produces tighter clusters than GMM 
     
**GMM clustering algorithm: ** 
  - advantages: 
     + Doesn't depend on assumptions (Prior info about the data) 
     + It provides soft clustering 
     + It is more scalabe than K-Means
     
 **The chosen algorithm: ** 
 Since the data is relatively small and the dimensionality was reduced, GMM will be better due to its ability to apply soft clustering which will help to provide more insights about the data than k-means. 




 

### Implementation: Creating Clusters
Depending on the problem, the number of clusters that you expect to be in the data may already be known. When the number of clusters is not known *a priori*, there is no guarantee that a given number of clusters best segments the data, since it is unclear what structure exists in the data â€” if any. However, we can quantify the "goodness" of a clustering by calculating each data point's *silhouette coefficient*. The [silhouette coefficient](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score.html) for a data point measures how similar it is to its assigned cluster from -1 (dissimilar) to 1 (similar). Calculating the *mean* silhouette coefficient provides for a simple scoring method of a given clustering.

In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
 - Fit a clustering algorithm to the `reduced_data` and assign it to `clusterer`.
 - Predict the cluster for each data point in `reduced_data` using `clusterer.predict` and assign them to `preds`.
 - Find the cluster centers using the algorithm's respective attribute and assign them to `centers`.
 - Predict the cluster for each sample data point in `pca_samples` and assign them `sample_preds`.
 - Import `sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score` and calculate the silhouette score of `reduced_data` against `preds`.
   - Assign the silhouette score to `score` and print the result.


```python
from sklearn import mixture
from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score

def clustering(components):
    # Apply clustering algorithm of choice to the reduced data 
    clusterer = mixture.GaussianMixture(n_components=components).fit(reduced_data)
    # Predict the cluster for each data point
    preds = clusterer.predict(reduced_data)
    # Find the cluster centers
    centers = clusterer.means_
    # Predict the cluster for each transformed sample data point
    sample_preds = clusterer.predict(pca_samples)
    # Calculate the mean silhouette coefficient for the number of clusters chosen
    score = silhouette_score(reduced_data, preds, metric='euclidean')
    return score, preds, centers, sample_preds

```


```python
score = 0 
preds = 0
centers = 0;
sample_preds = np.array
resutls = []
for comp in range(2,8):
    tmp_score, tmp_preds, tmp_centers, tmp_sample_preds = clustering(comp)
    if tmp_score > score: 
        score = tmp_score
        preds = tmp_preds
        centers = tmp_centers
        sample_preds = tmp_sample_preds 
    resutls.append("For {} clusters, score is: {}".format(comp, tmp_score))
```

### Question 7

* Report the silhouette score for several cluster numbers you tried. 
* Of these, which number of clusters has the best silhouette score?

**Answer:**


```python
for res in resutls:
    print(res)
```

    For 2 clusters, score is: 0.4223246826459388
    For 3 clusters, score is: 0.40424873824078794
    For 4 clusters, score is: 0.2894015790851912
    For 5 clusters, score is: 0.2730879800220302
    For 6 clusters, score is: 0.3319987041013967
    For 7 clusters, score is: 0.30890023827116236


As we can see the highest score was for 2 clusters 

### Cluster Visualization
Once you've chosen the optimal number of clusters for your clustering algorithm using the scoring metric above, you can now visualize the results by executing the code block below. Note that, for experimentation purposes, you are welcome to adjust the number of clusters for your clustering algorithm to see various visualizations. The final visualization provided should, however, correspond with the optimal number of clusters. 


```python
# Display the results of the clustering from implementation
vs.cluster_results(reduced_data, preds, centers, pca_samples)
```


![png](output_60_0.png)


### Implementation: Data Recovery
Each cluster present in the visualization above has a central point. These centers (or means) are not specifically data points from the data, but rather the *averages* of all the data points predicted in the respective clusters. For the problem of creating customer segments, a cluster's center point corresponds to *the average customer of that segment*. Since the data is currently reduced in dimension and scaled by a logarithm, we can recover the representative customer spending from these data points by applying the inverse transformations.

In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
 - Apply the inverse transform to `centers` using `pca.inverse_transform` and assign the new centers to `log_centers`.
 - Apply the inverse function of `np.log` to `log_centers` using `np.exp` and assign the true centers to `true_centers`.



```python
#Inverse transform the centers
log_centers = pca.inverse_transform(centers)

# TODO: Exponentiate the centers
true_centers = np.exp(log_centers)

# Display the true centers
segments = ['Segment {}'.format(i) for i in range(0,len(centers))]
true_centers = pd.DataFrame(np.round(true_centers), columns = data.keys())
true_centers.index = segments
display(true_centers)
```

**Segment 0	** <br> 
    - Milk > Mean(Milk) 
    - Frsh < Mean(fresh)
    - Frozen < Mean(frozen)
    - Grocery > Mean(Grocery)
    - Detergents_Paper > Mean(Detergents_Paper)
    - Delicatessen < Mean(Delicatessen)
    
Also, we can see that the following features are considered to be in the upper 75% of the data: 
    - Milk 
    - Grocery 
    - Detergents_Paper
We can say that the Segment represents super markets stores or cafes.  
    
 
 
 **Segment 1 ** <br> 
    - Milk < Mean(Milk) 
    - Frsh < Mean(fresh)
    - Frozen < Mean(frozen)
    - Grocery < Mean(Grocery)
    - Detergents_Paper < Mean(Detergents_Paper)
    - Delicatessen < Mean(Delicatessen)
    
However, we can see that it is higher in frozen and fresh than Segment 0, this Segment could represents restaurants. 
 

### Question 9

* For each sample point, which customer segment from* **Question 8** *best represents it? 
* Are the predictions for each sample point consistent with this?*

Run the code block below to find which cluster each sample point is predicted to be.


```python
# Display the predictions
for i, pred in enumerate(sample_preds):
    print("Sample point", i, "predicted to be in Cluster", pred)
```

    Sample point 0 predicted to be in Cluster 0
    Sample point 1 predicted to be in Cluster 0
    Sample point 2 predicted to be in Cluster 0


**Answer:**

We can see the three points were predicted were predicted to be in Cluster 0 which we assumed to be super markets stores or cafes. 

For the first sample point, which is customer with index 2, I Predicted it to be a barbeque restaurant, however this does not agree with the prediction above. 
For the second sample point, which is customer with index 100, I Predicted it to be a super market store, which agrees with the above prediction. Same as for the third sample point, customer 200 which I  Predicted it to be a coffee house. This also agrees with the prediction above. 


## Conclusion

In this final section, you will investigate ways that you can make use of the clustered data. First, you will consider how the different groups of customers, the ***customer segments***, may be affected differently by a specific delivery scheme. Next, you will consider how giving a label to each customer (which *segment* that customer belongs to) can provide for additional features about the customer data. Finally, you will compare the ***customer segments*** to a hidden variable present in the data, to see whether the clustering identified certain relationships.

### Question 10
Companies will often run [A/B tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing) when making small changes to their products or services to determine whether making that change will affect its customers positively or negatively. The wholesale distributor is considering changing its delivery service from currently 5 days a week to 3 days a week. However, the distributor will only make this change in delivery service for customers that react positively. 

* How can the wholesale distributor use the customer segments to determine which customers, if any, would react positively to the change in delivery service?*



**Answer:**

We can't assume that the change affects all customers equally since there are differences in their spendings. However, we can assume that the change will affect each segmant equally. By that, we can apply the A/B test for each segment separately. This will show the which segment will react positively and which segment will react negatively. 

### Question 11
Additional structure is derived from originally unlabeled data when using clustering techniques. Since each customer has a ***customer segment*** it best identifies with (depending on the clustering algorithm applied), we can consider *'customer segment'* as an **engineered feature** for the data. Assume the wholesale distributor recently acquired ten new customers and each provided estimates for anticipated annual spending of each product category. Knowing these estimates, the wholesale distributor wants to classify each new customer to a ***customer segment*** to determine the most appropriate delivery service.  
* How can the wholesale distributor label the new customers using only their estimated product spending and the **customer segment** data?



**Answer:**

By introducing a new feture into each data that shows its cluster, we can apply supervised learner algorithm and train it to distinguish between these clusters based on the original features. As we have a good model that can identify the cluster, we can predict the clusters of the new customers using that model. Of course here the target variable will be the cluster (Segment) that the new customers belong to. 


### Visualizing Underlying Distributions

At the beginning of this project, it was discussed that the `'Channel'` and `'Region'` features would be excluded from the dataset so that the customer product categories were emphasized in the analysis. By reintroducing the `'Channel'` feature to the dataset, an interesting structure emerges when considering the same PCA dimensionality reduction applied earlier to the original dataset.

Run the code block below to see how each data point is labeled either `'HoReCa'` (Hotel/Restaurant/Cafe) or `'Retail'` the reduced space. In addition, you will find the sample points are circled in the plot, which will identify their labeling.


```python
# Display the clustering results based on 'Channel' data
vs.channel_results(reduced_data, outliers, pca_samples)
```

### Question 12

* How well does the clustering algorithm and number of clusters you've chosen compare to this underlying distribution of Hotel/Restaurant/Cafe customers to Retailer customers? 
* Are there customer segments that would be classified as purely 'Retailers' or 'Hotels/Restaurants/Cafes' by this distribution? 
* Would you consider these classifications as consistent with your previous definition of the customer segments?

**Answer:**

We can see that the use of GMM is a good choice since its result was very close to the above clustering based on the channel. However, we notice that there is an overlap in the above result, this overlap wasn't reflected by thr GMM algorithm. The result shows also that the points that have X >=2 are classified as purely Retailers where those which have  x < -3 are  classified as purely Hotels/Restaurants/Cafes. 

The classifications above are not precisely consistent with my previous definition of the customer segments. Although my definition was that Segment 0 is super market which can be considered as a Retailers and Segment 1 to be restaurants, I also added the possibility of segement 0 to be a coffee house which by the above definition belongs to Segment 1.
